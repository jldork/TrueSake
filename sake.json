The nose is obviously very citrusy and the first sip \u2013 after you smile \u2013 says that this is not a silly sake but a very flavorful drinking experience. There is an abundance of fat and chewy (but not goopy) citrus flavors that are balanced by a firm acidity all on a smooth and expansive flow. It is sweet, but not overtly so.
